== Overview

jQAssistant is a tool supporting the process for developing Java applications. It is based on the graph database http://neo4j.org[Neo4j] and can be plugged into the Maven build process to break the build on detection of constraint violations and generate reports about user defined concepts and metrics.

Here are some example use cases:

- Enforce naming conventions, e.g. EJBs, JPA entities, test classes, packages, maven modules etc.
- Validate dependencies between modules of your project
- separate API and implementation classes (e.g. a module must only have dependencies to API classes of other components)
- detect common problems, e.g cyclic dependencies, tests without assertions, etc.
- define and gather project specific metrics

The rules are specified using Cypher - the Neo4j query language:

[source]
----
match
  (t:Test:Method)
where not
  (t)-[:INVOKES]->(:Assert:Method)
return
  t as TestWithoutAssertion
----
