==== Custom Rule Plugin

Rules (i.e. concepts, constraints or groups) can be shared between projects by packaging their rule descriptors in JAR artifacts as a classpath resources under /META-INF/jqassistant-rules/, e.g.

[source,xml]
./META-INF/jqassistant-rules/common.xml
----
include::{docRoot}/jqassistant.examples.plugins.rule/src/src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-rules/common.xml[]
----

Furthermore these resources must be declared in the jQAssistant plugin descriptor /META-INF/jqassistant-plugin.xml:

[source,xml]
./META-INF/jqassistant-plugin.xml
----
include::{docRoot}/jqassistant.examples.plugins.rule/src/src/main/resources/META-INF/jqassistant-plugin.xml[]
----

The plugin and its rules are automatically loaded by the analyzer if it can be found on the classpath, e.g. by adding it as dependency to the maven plugin.
